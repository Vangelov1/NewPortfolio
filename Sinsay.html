                                    <p>There were several things that stood out at first glance that really bothered me when I first inspected the website layout and the structure of the current design. A lot of inconsistencies are clearly visible and hierarchy issues that show up.  
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote><p>Let's start with what we are greeted with. The first thing we see is the header navigation and the lower banner. </p></blockquote>
                                    <h4 class="bold-title">1.The Home Page</h4>
                                    <img style="padding-bottom: 10px;" src="img/sinsay/analisis/Mask Group 65.jpg" alt="" class="fl-wrap">
                                    
                                    <br>
                                    <p>1.1 Let's start off by saying that the texts that are stuck on the top are battling for attention with the main banner.  Also, nobody has the time to read all of the second text fields which is for the GDPR cookies.  Leaving the first sticky bar with the green background is OK, but having them both is too much and it diverts attention from the banner.  </p>
                                    <p>1.2 The overall composition looks really bad, it looks unorganized even though it's all there in some arrangement, simply rearranging things and adding some hierarchy makes everything look more organized and uncluttered. Also, most of the items on the navigation are weighting on the right, leaving just the language switcher on the left, which is too small to be there by itself. </p>
                                    <p>1.3 The banner Image to text ratio is too much, the picture is so big that the text loses itself In it, also saying that the text block with the button's isn't perfectly aligned in the middle, which adds to the cluttered feeing. </p>
                                     <p>1.4 The text element and the Item switcher below the banner should be one element that is in one section, where here it's split into two sections, in my mind brakes hierarchy and gives a feeling of too much space. </p>
                                    <p>1.5 The item slider brakes the canvas and overflows on the right, which isn't good for the composition. </p>
                                    <p>1.6 The newsletter subscription and the footer look really bad like that, and the footer layout is too much to the left and it looks like its misaligned.</p>

                                    <h4 class="bold-title">Design Goals</h4>
                                    <p>We had to create a user-friendly tool that provides a wide range of features in a package that is easy to be used by companies and individuals alike.</p>
                                    <p>The goals for the design were to develop something that would be functional and snappy.  We had to make it super clean and simple to use so people could navigate the menus at ease and have a clutter-free user experience. </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p> Because uptime was focused on a broad range of functionality, we ended up choosing a flat design with a minimal amount of colors, so we could provide a more focused User Experience. </p>

                                                <p> To be honest I didn't really spend so much time into chosing the right font for this project, I was more focused on pushing things so we can move to a demo version release as fast as possible.</p>

                                        One of the areas that I cut down on was branding. Essentially, branding would be one of the priority things that I would focus on but specifically for this project I decided to go simple and cut down on the design time for the logo and typography. The project itself is orientated towards functionality rather than aesthetics. With that in mind, I made a simple and clean logo, followed by a clean and bold typography that doesn’t go too hard on the eyes.

                                    <p>The end result within our minds is a perfect blend of simplicity and functionality. We managed to create a tool that is simple in nature but provides a very powerful spectrum of resources that help any scale of user to manage the health of their online presence, from large corporations to everyday individuals. Uptime monitor was designed to be able to scale as much as it is needed to.</p>
